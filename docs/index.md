# Welcome to the AI Agent Ecosystem Project

This project represents a groundbreaking approach to creating a dynamic and scalable AI agent ecosystem. With a focus on the future, we are leveraging multiple agent frameworks to craft a compelling AI agent project that stands out for its unique value proposition, competitive advantages, and potential for growth and scalability.

## Project Overview

The AI Agent Ecosystem Project is designed to be a unique and innovative platform that creates a total of 144 agents, divided into 72 angels and 72 demons. Each agent is empowered with 'legions to call', providing a multi-layered, complex system that simulates various aspects of decision-making and strategy.

## Key Features

- **144 Agents**: A diverse array of agents, each with unique capabilities and roles within the ecosystem.
- **72 Angels and 72 Demons**: A balanced representation of contrasting entities, offering a rich narrative and strategic depth.
- **Legions to Call**: Every agent has access to legions, expanding their influence and operational capacity.
- **Scalability**: Designed to grow and adapt with the integration of newer models like GPT-5 and beyond.
- **Interoperability**: Utilizes shared dependencies and consistent naming conventions for seamless integration across the ecosystem.
