- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient use of computational resources to facilitate the addition of more agents without compromising performance.

## Data and Models

Angel agents are powered by sophisticated models and data sets:

- **AngelModel**: Defined in `models/angel_model.py`, this model encapsulates the behavior and decision-making processes of angel agents.
- **Angel Data**: Stored in `data/angel_data.json`, this data provides the foundational attributes and historical context for each angel agent.

## Interactions and Legions

Each angel agent has the ability to call upon legions, which are smaller units of agents that can be deployed for specific tasks:

- **Legion Model**: Refer to `models/legion_model.py` for details on the structure and capabilities of legions.
- **Legion Data**: Information about legions can be found in `data/legion_data.json`.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available for interacting with angel agents:

- **List Angels**: `/api/angel` - Retrieve a list of all angel agents.
- **Angel Details**: `/api/angel/{id}` - Get details about a specific angel agent.

## Conclusion

Angel agents represent a cornerstone of our AI agent project, offering a blend of ethical guidance, proactive problem-solving, and scalable impact. As we look forward to the integration of more advanced models like GPT-5, the potential for our angel agents to revolutionize various sectors is immense.
