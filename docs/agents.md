# Agents

The Agents module is a cornerstone of our AI agent project, which aims to leverage a multi-agent framework ecosystem to create a groundbreaking and scalable platform. This document provides an overview of the Agents module, its structure, and its role within the project.

## Overview

The Agents module consists of a diverse collection of 144 AI agents, each with unique capabilities and purposes. These agents are designed to interact with each other, as well as with external systems, to perform complex tasks and solve problems in a distributed manner.

## Agent Types

There are two primary types of agents within this module:

- **Angel Agents**: 72 agents with characteristics and behaviors inspired by angelic figures. They are designed to promote positive outcomes and assist in beneficial tasks.
- **Demon Agents**: 72 agents with characteristics and behaviors inspired by demonic figures. They are designed to challenge, test, and ensure the robustness of systems.

Each agent, whether angelic or demonic, has the ability to call upon legions to perform tasks at scale.

## Agent Frameworks

The agents are built upon multiple frameworks to ensure versatility and adaptability. The `AGENT_FRAMEWORKS` variable in `config.py` defines the frameworks used.

## Key Features

- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Agents can communicate with each other to coordinate actions and share information.
- **Legion Invocation**: Each agent can invoke legions, which are smaller sub-agents that can be deployed en masse for large-scale operations.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Agents can learn from their environment and adapt their strategies over time.

## File Structure

The Agents module is organized into several files:

- `agents/__init__.py`: Initializes the Agents module and its components.
- `agents/base_agent.py`: Defines the base class for all agents, providing common functionality.
- `agents/angel_agent.py`: Implements the Angel Agent class.
- `agents/demon_agent.py`: Implements the Demon Agent class.
- `agents/legion.py`: Defines the Legion class, which represents a group of sub-agents.
- `agents/manager.py`: Manages the lifecycle and interactions of all agents.

## Data and Models

Each agent type has associated data and models:

- `data/agent_data.py`: Contains shared data structures and constants for agents.
- `data/angel_data.json`: Stores data specific to Angel Agents.
- `data/demon_data.json`: Stores data specific to Demon Agents.
- `models/angel_model.py`: Contains the machine learning models for Angel Agents.
- `models/demon_model.py`: Contains the machine learning models for Demon Agents.

## Utilities

Utility functions are provided to support agent operations:

- `utils/data_loader.py`: Loads data for agents from various sources.
- `utils/data_preprocessor.py`: Preprocesses data for use by agents.
- `utils/logger.py`: Logs events and actions taken by agents.

## Testing

The Agents module includes a suite of tests to ensure functionality and reliability:

- `tests/test_agents.py`: Tests the creation and operation of agents.
- `tests/test_data_loader.py`: Tests the data loading utilities.
- `tests/test_preprocessor.py`: Tests the data preprocessing utilities.

## Future Directions

As AI models continue to evolve, our Agents module is designed to be forward-compatible with upcoming advancements such as GPT-5. This ensures that our platform remains at the cutting edge of AI agent technology, ready to capitalize on new opportunities for growth and scalability.
